          Mike did his undergraduate degree at Stanford in Symbolic Systems and his PhD work at MIT. 
          He is broadly interested in the relationship between language and cognition, 
          especially as it relates to children's early language development.

          Bria did her undergraduate work at Stanford and is happy to be back on campus. 
          She spent two years at École Normale Supérieure in France before doing her graduate 
          work in vision science at Harvard University. Her postdoctoral work focuses on the 
          development of visual concepts. For example, how do children learn what is —- and what 
          isn't —- a cup? How do children's visual concepts change across development?

         Kat completed her PhD in developmental psychology at NYU in the Steinhardt School of Culture, 
         Education, and Human Development. She broadly studies how young children adapt their attention
         and learning behaviors to best match different early environments, with particular focus on 
         understanding variability and strengths in contexts of early adversity. A key aim of her 
         research is to create and collaborate on innovative uses of technology and statistical 
         methods to support education and developmental science.

         Received a BSC in electrical engineering from University of Khartoum, and then received a master degree 
         in computer science from Arizona state university and a master degree in cognitive science from Columbia 
         university. I have been interested in the study of cognitive development and language development in particular.
         I am intrigued by the intersection between language and cognition. I am also interested in the cross-cultural 
         approaches of conducting research in cognitive development.

          Grace is a Research Coordinator. I graduated from UC Berkeley where I completed my BA in philosophy and a minor in early childhood development and 
          learning science. I was a research assistant in the Gopnik Lab where I engaged with studies that seek to understand 
          the factors that influence children's decisions to explore or exploit their environment. I am broadly interested in 
          expanding my understanding of different approaches in the field. Children's development of morality and beliefs about 
          right and wrong also interests me. I am excited to learn more about children’s learning, behavior, and beliefs.
