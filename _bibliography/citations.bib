	abstract = {How do we know what others know? Prior work has examined
how children use evidence about isolated agents, like their
perceptual access and actions, to infer what they know. However,
humans are rarely fully isolated; instead, we are often
surrounded by others whom we interact with, influence, and
are influenced by. In these contexts, we can use a speaker’s
communication and the way it causes a listener to behave to
infer what that speaker knows - even if we do not know the
specific content of what was communicated. The present studies
investigated how preschool-aged children use two pieces of
evidence about listeners to reason about what speakers know:
changes in the outcomes of a listener’s actions following communication
(Study 1) and changes in a listener’s actions themselves
following communication (Study 2). In both studies,
children observed two scenarios where a listener failed to activate
a toy before succeeding. In Study 1, children observed
a speaker produce nonsense language towards a listener after
they failed but before they succeeded to activate a toy, as
well as another speaker who spoke to a listener prior to initial
failure. In Study 2, children observed a speaker communicate
with a listener before a distinct change in action, followed by
success, as well as another speaker who communicated with a
listener resulting in no distinct change in action, followed by
success. When asked which speaker knows how to make the
toy work, 5 year-olds chose the speaker who appeared to cause
the listener to succeed (Study 1) or change their action (Study
2). These results suggest that preschool-aged children are sensitive
to the way speakers influence others via communication
and can use evidence of that influence to infer what speakers
know. More broadly, these studies highlight children’s ability
to reason about the knowledge of one agent (a speaker) based
primarily on evidence about another agent (a listener).},

	abstract = {Prior work demonstrates an early-emerging understanding of
how speakers can alter listeners’ minds and actions. Yet, an abstract
understanding of communication entails more than forward
inferences about its influence on the listener; it also supports
inverse inferences about the speaker based on its causal
influence over the listener. Can children reason about the
minds of speakers based on their causal influence over listeners?
Across three studies, children viewed two communicative
exchanges where a listener attempted to activate a toy; we manipulated
when speakers communicated (Exp.1), how listeners’
subsequent actions changed (Exp.2), and whether speakers
spoke or sneezed (Exp.3). By 5 years of age, children inferred
the speaker who appeared to cause the listener to succeed was
more knowledgeable, but only when they produced speech.
These results suggest children can reason causally about the
sources of communication, identifying knowledgeable speakers
based on their influence over a listener’s actions and their
outcomes.},

	abstract = {Head-mounted cameras have been used in developmental psychology research for more than a
decade to provide a rich and comprehensive view of what infants see during their everyday
experiences. However, variation between these devices has limited the field’s ability to compare
results across studies and across labs. Further, the video data captured by these cameras to date
has been relatively low-resolution, limiting how well machine learning algorithms can operate
over these rich video data. Here, we provide a well-tested and easily constructed design for a
head-mounted camera assembly—the BabyView—developed in collaboration with Daylight
Design, LLC., a professional product design firm. The BabyView collects high-resolution video,
accelerometer, and gyroscope data from children approximately 6 - 30 months of age via a
GoPro camera custom mounted on a soft child-safety helmet. The BabyView also captures a
large, portrait-oriented vertical field-of-view that encompasses both children’s interactions with
objects and with their social partners. We detail our protocols for video data management and
for handling sensitive data from home environments. We also provide customizable materials
for onboarding families with the BabyView. We hope that these materials will encourage the
wide adoption of the BabyView, allowing the field to collect high-resolution data that can link
children’s everyday environments with their learning outcomes.},
